##✅ Bike Sales Data Analysis – Excel Project
Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, organizing, and analyzing a bike sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. 
The main objective was to transform raw, inconsistent data into a clear and interactive dashboard that highlights key sales insights.

##🔧 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

I began by preparing the dataset in a dedicated working sheet:

#✔ Added an “Age Bracket” Column

Created a new column called Age Brackets

Used an IF formula to categorize customers into:

Adolescent

Middle Age

Old

This step improved readability and made the pivot charts more meaningful.

#✔ Removed Duplicates

Checked for duplicate records and removed them to ensure clean and reliable data.

#✔ Normalized Values (Consistent Labels)

Some fields had inconsistent short codes (letters only), so I standardized them:

“M” → Male

“F” → Female

“M” → Married

“S” → Single

(Used Find & Replace to clean all data quickly.)

#✔ Verified Data Quality

Ensured no empty cells, no repeated values, and no spelling errors.

Confirmed all numeric fields were in the correct format.

##📊 2. Pivot Tables Creation

I created multiple pivot tables to analyze different dimensions of the data:

#✔ Customer Commute (Distance vs Purchase Behavior)

Showed how far customers travel and whether they purchased a bike.

#✔ Age Bracket Analysis

Compared bike purchases across Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old groups.

#✔ Income vs Purchase

Analyzed average income per purchase, split by gender.

Each pivot table was formatted and modified to improve clarity.

##📈 3. Pivot Charts Development

For each pivot table, I created a corresponding pivot chart:

Line charts for commute and age bracket patterns

Bar charts for income comparison

Customized titles, labels, and colors for readability

Charts were cleaned and prepared for dashboard integration.

##🖥 4. Dashboard Creation

I built a clean and interactive dashboard on a new sheet:

#Dashboard Features

/Title banner: "Bike Sales Dashboard"

Organized layout with:

-Income chart

-Age bracket chart

-Commute analysis chart

#Slicers added for interactive filtering:

-Marital Status

This allows users to dynamically explore the data and extract insights instantly.
